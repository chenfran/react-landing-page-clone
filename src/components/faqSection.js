          <h3>What are Robotos?</h3>
          <p>
            Robotos is a collection of algorithmically generated droid
            characters designed by Pablo Stanley and minted as NFTs on the
            Ethereum blockchain. The 1st generation of 10,000 droids will be
            constructed from various metal outfits, tin faces, digital
            accessories, top pieces, faces, backpacks, arms, and colors. Robotos
            have different body types, some rarer than others, and... there are
            rumors that you could find humans pretending to be robots too. Is it
            true? ðŸ¤”

            tools. Niklas has led the Discord management, bots, security, and
            adventures. Bureboto and Captain Excellent have expanded the art and
            world of Robotos and added their unique design vision to the
            project.

            Buttts, Bottts, and Open Doodles. He's also the creator of The
            Design Team comics series.

          <h3>What's an NFT?</h3>
          <p>
            NFT stands for "Non-fungible token," which means that it's a unique,
            digital item with blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy,
            own, and trade. Some NFT's fundamental function is to be digital
            art. But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive
            access to websites, event tickets, game items, and ownership records
            for physical objects. Think of it as a unique piece of art that can
            also work as a "members-only" card. Robotos works like this.

          <p>
            New to NFTs? No worries, here are some steps on what you need to do
            to get your Roboto.
            <br />
            <br />
            Download the metamask.io extension for the Chrome/Brave browser or
            app on mobile. This will allow you to make purchases with Ethereum
            and can be found in the extensions tab. If you are on mobile, you
            must use the Metamask App Browser You can purchase Ethereum through
            the Metamask Wallet using Wyre or Send Ethereum from an exchange
            like Coinbase. Click on Connect at the top of the page and connect
            your Metamask. Once joined, you will be able to purchase the NFTs in
            the mint section. You will be prompted to sign your transaction.
            FYI, there will be a fee associated with every transaction related
            to gas prices. Once you have made your purchase, your Roboto NFTs
            will be viewable in your wallet and on OpenSea.
